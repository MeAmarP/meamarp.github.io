## Introduction

Following are my notes on BYTE, simple and effective association method. Proposed in paper *ByteTrack: Multi-Object Tracking by Associating Every Detection Box*.

## BYTE, The Algo?
![Pseudo-code of BYTE](../assets/img/byte.png "Pseudo-code of BYTE")
- For each frame in the video, we predict the detection boxes and scores using the detector **Det**.
- We separate all the detection boxes **D<sub>boxes</sub>** into two parts **D<sub>high</sub>** and **D<sub>low</sub>** according to the detection score threshold **τ**.
- detection boxes, **D<sub>boxes</sub>** > **τ** stored into **D<sub>high</sub>**
- detection boxes, **D<sub>boxes</sub>** < **τ** stored into **D<sub>low</sub>**
- Use **Kalman Filter** to predict new location in current frame for each track in **T**;
- First association is performed between **D<sub>high</sub>** and all the tracks **T** (including the lost tracks **T<sub>lost</sub>** ) using `Similarity #1`.
- `Similarity #1` can be computed either by the **IoU** or the **Re-ID** feature distances between the **D<sub>high</sub>** and the predicted box of tracks **T**.
- Next, we adopt **Hungarian Algorithm** to finish the matching based on the similarity.
- We keep the unmatched detections in **D<sub>remain</sub>** and the unmatched tracks in **T<sub>remain</sub>**.
- Second association is performed between the low score detection boxes **D<sub>low</sub>** and the remaining tracks **T<sub>remain</sub>** after the first association.
- We keep the unmatched tracks in **T<sub>re-remain</sub>** and just delete all the unmatched low score detection boxes, since we view them as background.
- We find it important to use **IoU** alone as the `Similarity #2` in the second association because the low score detection boxes usually contains severe occlusion or motion blur and appearance features are not reliable.
- For the unmatched tracks **T<sub>re-remain</sub>** after the second association, we put them into **T<sub>lost</sub>**.
- For each track in **T<sub>lost</sub>** , only when it exists for more than a certain number of frames, i.e. 30, we delete it from the tracks **T** . Otherwise, we remain the lost tracks **T<sub>lost</sub>** in **T**.
- Finally, we initialize new tracks from the unmatched high score detection boxes **D<sub>remain</sub>** after the first association.
- The output of each individual frame is the bounding boxes and identities of the tracks **T** in the current frame.
